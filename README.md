<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Game - </h1>
<p>Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game, also known as Noughts and Crosses. It is played on a 3x3 grid where each player takes turns marking a cell in the grid with their symbolâ€”one player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'. The objective is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
